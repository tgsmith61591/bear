About the project
=================

Bear is a product of an open-source developer who got tired of creating new
projects. The idea behind Bear is that a developer should be able to go from
idea to MVP in as quick a time as possible. By templating out the mundane parts
of setting up a project's CI/CD pipeline, layout, and build-scripts, Bear enables
developers to "bear fruit" more quickly.


How it works
------------

Given a configuration, Bear builds a new package with a custom setup script,
requirements and submodules all tailored towards your project's demands. Bear
contains a number of templates for CI/CD scripts, documentation and other utilities
that are formatted at runtime to build your package.

**If you encounter any issues in the project, please see the** :ref:`filing_bugs` **section for how to file an issue.**
