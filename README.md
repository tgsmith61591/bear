# :grapes: bear

*Create more. Innovate more easily. Bear fruit more quickly.*

Bear helps to structurally automate creating a python package and
its corresponding documentation and CI/CD pipelines so a developer
can jump right into developing the next big thing.


### What is it?

Often times a developer is struck with an idea and then ends up spending valuable
time that could be spent prototyping just putting together the structure of a
project (including doc, CI/CD pipelines, etc.). Bear streamlines that to allow
you to move straight into the code-writing.

```bash
$ python -m bear --name my_project
```
